      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
        We begin with one bold act: building the very first Actum residence—where residents will live entirely free of charge. No rent. No mortgage. Just the freedom to exist without paying for a roof over your head.
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
        Applicants will enter through a lottery system—removing power dynamics, favoritism, bureaucracy, and gatekeeping. It’s unbiased justice. The application open to everyone regardless of income— followed by a basic background check to ensure the safety of the community. Those selected will move into homes that are beautiful, permanent, and theirs.

        This first home is more than shelter. It’s a declaration, hope made physical. It is undeniable proof that the system of life can be reimagined—and that housing can be universal, fair, and free. Actum challenges the lie that there’s “not enough” land, money, or goodwill. We can rewrite the rules and we can do it sustainably.

      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
        To make this happen—and to make it last—we’re building a powerful financial engine. We are raising a foundational fund through a strategic combination of investments, donations, and sustainable revenue sources like our merchandise line. By then investing in stable market assets like the S&amp;P 500, which has an average annual return of 8%, our fund generates recurring returns—returns that build new homes every year, indefinitely.

        This mission is an infrastructure for justice. It’s a system designed to grow forever.

      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
        Rent traps people in debt, strains finances, imposes burdens and stress that otherwise keep people from personal development and freedom. But there doesn’t need to be a reason why homes should be free. The basics of life are being sold to us. It’s your right. We are doing this because it’s fair.

      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
        Once the first Actum residence is complete, we expand. More buildings, more cities, more people—all selected by lottery. No discrimination. No income barriers. Just access. Actum will then plant seeds of universal housing to other countries across the earth.
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
        We are working toward a world where free housing is not a make-believe dream, but a birthright. Where paying to exist becomes a thing of the past. And where the idea that no one will do anything about it is finally, permanently, proven wrong.
